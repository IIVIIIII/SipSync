## 📊 Data Used

We use the **MTG-Jamendo dataset**, a large-scale open-source music dataset consisting of:

- 55,000+ Creative Commons-licensed audio tracks  
- 195 tags across genre, instrument, and mood/theme categories  

For this project, we focus on the **mood/theme subset** (~18,000 tracks), which is suitable for mood classification tasks.
